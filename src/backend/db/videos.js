      "Hoisting in JavaScript is the most famous Interview Question. And it is also one of the most misunderstood concepts in JS. This video will cover in-depth knowledge and fundamentals behind variable and function hoisting. Hoisting as a core concept relies on the way how Execution Context is created. In the first phase i.e. the Memory Allocation Phase all the variables and functions are allocated memory, even before any code is executed. All the variables are assigned undefined at this point in time in the local memory. ",
